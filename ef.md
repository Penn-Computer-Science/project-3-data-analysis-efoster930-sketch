## Data Overview
- **Link to Raw Data File (CSV):** [Download here](ef2.csv)
- **Number of Columns:** 5
- **Number of Rows:** 26
- **Any Cleaning Steps Taken:** I first removed numbers that could cause the .csv to not work with the analysis and anything that was not part of the argument. Another thing that I did was remove some of the fake data and added the real data from my survey. Anything that was not what I asked for or was wrong I changed the value to the correct thing that I wanted.
